Fpv drone mod for Assetto Corsa.

## New to FPV drones
FPV drones are hard to fly just starting out, but it's rewarding once you get the hang of it.
By default 3D mode is enabled, which makes the lower half of the throttle spin the motors backwards.
This is not how FPV drones work, the motors can only spin one way.
3D mode makes it much easier to fly with a game controller.

## Install
Requires Custom Shaders Patch 0.1.79 or above.
Make sure the downloaded folder/zip is named "FpvDrone".
Drag the downloaded FpvDrone folder/zip into content manager, click on the menu icon(3 horizontal lines) at the top right corner, and click install.

## Setup
When in game open the "Fpv Drone" app. If you use dualshock4 or xbox360 controllers select the corresponding preset and check if "Input device" setting in "Input" tab is right.
For other controllers go to the "Input" tab and adjust every setting so the Input Display at the top of the app displays correctly.
If you can't see your controller in the "Input device" menu make sure it was plugged in at AC launch and it's listed in the Windows "Game controllers" menu (Win+R, type "joy.cpl", Enter).

You can put any value in a slider by Ctrl+LeftClicking on it and typing in the value.
